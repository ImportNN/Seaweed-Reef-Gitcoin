# Seaweed-Reef-Gitcoin
### IDO MVP Plataform creation for the Gitcoin Hackathon.
This Repo contains the contracts that **I** was building for the [Gitcoin Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/issue/reef-defi/reef-finance-bounties/3/100026840,) util my teammate who should do the front-end decided to steal this contracts and participate by himself.

Feel free to use them. Contracts folder contain the 2 main contracts (**SeaWeed.sol** and **SeaweedStaking.sol**) along with some complementary contracts.

Onlything left on the Solidity dev side is to make the final contract (or contracts if you have different tiers) to make a mock IDO by making a whitelist with the staking addresses from the staking contract.

The Product called *SeaWeed* should encourage anyone that wants to participate in an *IDO* to buy Seaweed tokens and stake them in order to participate. 
Different tiers when an IDO launches should be created to reward big stakers.
